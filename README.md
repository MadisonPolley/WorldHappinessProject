# WorldHappinessProject
This repository is dedicated to my semester-long group project for Stat 479: Data Visualizations for Data Science.

The goal of this project is to combine the complete cases of the Wold Happiness Survey data from the years 2015 through 2019 and create visualizations to tell a story about how the data compares between country and year.
All data cleaning and analysis is being done in R.

Milestone 2 is where I cleaned and wrangled the data into a nicer format to present to my professor. Milestone 3 is where my group compiled our project description, thesis statement, preliminary graphs, descriptive graphs, and possible conclusions as a rough draft of our project.
